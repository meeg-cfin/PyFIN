# PyFIN
Monthly Python meeting at CFIN.

### What is PyFIN?

PyFIN is a monthly meeting for all Python-newbies and -fanatics, -lovers and -haters at CFIN. Everyone is welcome to bring their questions and problems - short intros to beloved Python-packages are very welcome, too! You can come to get help, insights into other people's pipelines and strategies, new ideas, and of course, to help others.


### This repository

This repository hosts the material for these meetings, mostly related to short introductions to Python-packages.
